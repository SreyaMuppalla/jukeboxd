## Jukeboxd
Music is a core part of Gen Zâ€™s culture, yet there is no centralized platform for music reviews. Instead, discussions are scattered across several online platforms, which are cluttered and lack structured review systems. Jukeboxd bridges this gap by providing a dedicated, community-driven space for music lovers to rate, review, and discuss their favorite songs and artists.

## Installation and Getting started
```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```
