## Overview
Music is a core part of Gen Zâ€™s culture, yet there is no centralized platform for music reviews. Instead, discussions are scattered across several online platforms, which are cluttered and lack structured review systems. Jukeboxd bridges this gap by providing a dedicated, community-driven space for music lovers to rate, review, and discuss their favorite songs and artists.

- Home Feed
   - Trending Songs and Albums
   - Search bar for song, album and artist discovery
   - Algorithm for recommendations according to friend reviews
- Song, Album and Artist Pages
   - View entities with relevant information retreived from the Spotify API
   - Entrypoint popup to cretae your own reviews
